Every year, [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) gifts us with a beautiful presentation of the music we love so much.

But honestly, who wants to wait a whole year to unwrap their musical gift? Certainly not me! ðŸ˜œ

That's why I decided to put an end to the endless wait and create 'Spotily', my own musical treasure chest. ðŸ’¿

With this interface, I can check my Charts anytime, without having to wait for the holiday season. ðŸŽµ
